### Hi there 👋

#### About Me

👨‍🎓 Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Information Technology.

⚙️ Immersed in the world of AI/ML, with a particular focus on deep learning projects. I enjoy unraveling complex problems using frameworks like PyTorch, especially in areas like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and sequence models.

🖥️ Although my current passion lies in AI/ML, I have a background in full-stack development and computer graphics projects which has honed my problem-solving skills.

🤝 Open to collaborations on intriguing AI/ML projects. The idea of working together to solve real-world problems excites me!

#### Technologies & Tools

**Languages**: C/C++, Java, Python, Solidity, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
**Frameworks**: PyTorch, React, Node.js
